# Spam Email Detection Streamlit App

## Description

The goal of this project is to develop an email spam detection system that classifies incoming emails using machine learning methods. We seek to construct a reliable and effective spam detector that can reliably identify and categorise emails based on their content and characteristics. To this end, we train the model on a labelled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
